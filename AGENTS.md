# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Don Macchiatos Ops

Internal phone-first ops app for Don Macchiatos, Don Lemon, and Yogurt.

- Next.js 16 App Router lives under `src/app`. Auth refresh belongs in `src/proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`.
- Demo mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`) uses `src/lib/demo/store.ts`. Live mode uses Supabase + RLS in `supabase/migrations`.
- Roles: `superadmin` (all businesses), `admin` (one branch), `user` (one branch, daily entry only).
- Products belong to a business; prices belong to a branch. Sales rows snapshot `unit_price_snapshot`.
- Dates are calendar dates in `Asia/Manila`. Do not record future days.
- Keep the UI mobile-first: large tap targets, bottom navigation, max width `max-w-md`.
